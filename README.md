[MICE: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations](http://stefvanbuuren.github.io/mice/)
==========================================================================================

Description
-----------

The [`mice`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mice) package implements a method to deal with missing data. The package creates multiple imputations (replacement values) for multivariate missing data. The method is based on Fully Conditional Specification, where each incomplete variable is imputed by a separate model. The `MICE` algorithm can impute mixes of continuous, binary, unordered categorical and ordered categorical data. In addition, MICE can impute continuous two-level data, and maintain consistency between imputations by means of passive imputation. Many diagnostic plots are implemented to inspect the quality of the imputations.

Installation
------------

The `mice` package can be installed from CRAN as follows:

``` r
install.packages("mice")
```

The latest version is can be installed from GitHub as follows:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "stefvanbuuren/mice")
```

Overview
--------

The `mice` package contains functions to

-   Inspect the missing data pattern
-   Impute the missing data *m* times, resulting in *m* completed data sets
-   Diagnose the quality of the imputed values
-   Analyze each completed data set
-   Pool the results of the repeated analyses
-   Store and export the imputed data in various formats
-   Generate simulated incomplete data
-   Incorporate custom imputation methods

New feature in version 2.41: User may choose which cells to impute.

Main functions
--------------

The main functions in the `mice` package are:

| Function name | Description                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| `mice()`      | Impute the missing data *m* times |
| `with()`      | Analyze completed data sets       |
| `pool()`      | Combine parameter estimates       |
| `complete()`  | Export imputed data               |
| `ampute()`    | Generate missing data             |

One-day course in `mice`
------------------------

If you are new to `mice` consider studying the materials of our one-day course in Winnigpeg. The materials are at [https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/Winnipeg](https://stefvanbuuren.github.io/Winnipeg/).

Further reading
---------------

The `mice` [software](https://www.jstatsoft.org/v45/i03/paper) was published in the Journal of Statistical Software (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011). The first application of the method concerned [missing blood pressure](http://www.stefvanbuuren.nl/publications/Multiple%20imputation%20-%20Stat%20Med%201999.pdf) data (Buuren, Boshuizen, and Knook 1999). The term [Fully Conditional Specification](http://www.stefvanbuuren.nl/publications/FCS%20in%20multivariate%20imputation%20-%20JSCS%202006.pdf) was introduced in 2006 to describe a general class of methods that specify imputations model for multivariate data as a set of conditional distributions (Buuren et al. 2006). Details about imputing [mixes of numerical and categorical data](http://www.stefvanbuuren.nl/publications/MI%20by%20FCS%20-%20SMMR%202007.pdf) can be found in (Buuren 2007). [Wulff and Ejlskov](http://www.ejbrm.com/issue/download.html?idArticle=450) provide a comprehensive overview of MICE. Many more details and applications can be found in the book *Flexible Imputation of Missing Data* (Buuren 2012) (see [Chapman & Hall/CRC](https://www.crcpress.com/Flexible-Imputation-of-Missing-Data/van-Buuren/p/book/9781439868249) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Flexible-Imputation-Missing-Interdisciplinary-Statistics/dp/1439868247/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1439868247&pd_rd_r=DC8AYZZZZKF9GZSVP6PK&pd_rd_w=Z2PJQ&pd_rd_wg=3iuSi&psc=1&refRID=DC8AYZZZZKF9GZSVP6PK)).
